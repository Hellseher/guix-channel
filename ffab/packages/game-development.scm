    (description
     "Virality Engine provides a system and workflow that helps describe the
elements needed to write 2D or 3D games.  It was designed with several domain
specific languages that make it easier to describe, manipulate, and use assets
commonly found in game making.  Such assets include (but are not limited to)
textures, materials, shader programs, and scene trees of actors that are
available for instantiation.  Virality Engine also knows how to accept input
from keyboards and most joysticks and gamepads.

The component system is a hybrid model between an ECS and an object model.  The
components are defined similar to CLOS defclass, and regular generic methods
can be used with them.  Components are added to Actors which represent game
concepts like players, scenery, effects, etc.  We define a component protocol
invoked by Virality Engine to move your components to the next state and
render them each frame.")
