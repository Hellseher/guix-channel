    (description
     "This package permits one to perform floating-point computations (real and
complex) to arbitrarily high numeric precision, by making only relatively minor
changes to existing Fortran-90 programs (mostly changes to type statements).  All
basic arithmetic operations and transcendental functions are supported, together
with numerous special functions.")
