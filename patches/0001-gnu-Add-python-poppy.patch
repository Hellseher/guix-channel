+     "@acronym{POPPY, Physical Optics Propagation in Python} is a Python package that
+simulates physical optical propagation including diffraction.  It implements a
+flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction and point
+spread function formation, particularly in the context of astronomical
+telescopes.
+
+POPPY was developed as part of a simulation package for the James Webb Space
+Telescope, but is more broadly applicable to many kinds of imaging simulations.
+It is not, however, a substitute for high fidelity optical design software such
+as Zemax or Code V, but rather is intended as a lightweight alternative for
+cases for which diffractive rather than geometric optics is the topic of
+interest, and which require portability between platforms or ease of scripting.")
