+approximate solutions to the eigenvalue problem in standard form with main
+goals:
+
+@itemize
+@item Having a native Julia implementation of the @code{eigs} function that
+performs as well as ARPACK.  With native we mean that its implementation should
+be generic and support any number type.  Currently the partialschur function
+does not depend on LAPACK, and removing the last remnants of direct calls to
+BLAS is in the pipeline.
+
+@item Removing the dependency of the Julia language on ARPACK.  This goal was
+already achieved before the package was stable enough, since ARPACK moved to a
+separate repository @code{Arpack.jl}.
